# Copyright Management System using Blockchain
Image theft and copyright issues have been increasing rapidly with the rise of the internet. Therefore, **copyright protection** of images has become an unavoidable issue. 
**Blockchain** is a distributed database that provides a *secure yet transparent* way to protect any type of records.
Our system gives users an option to **encrypt** their personal information with their piece of art and register it on blockchain, at same time using *image processing* algorithms it makes sure no **duplicacy or piracy** of your work.

## Project Overview
- Firstly we have to provide the details of owner  i.e. owner name, owner email, image title and image.
- By clicking on **submit** it will checks in the Blockchain for duplication and privacy using **Perceptual Hashing** technique.
- If the selected image is registered in the blockchain it will stop execution by showing the name of its original owner, else the image will be sent to the **Flask server (localhost:5000)** for its watermarking by using *Discrete Cosine Transform **(DCT)** and Discrete Wavelet Transform **(DWT)***.
- A **QR Code** is generated by using the *owners personal info* and the *perceptual hash of the image* then this QR will be watermarked with our image.
- After that the generated QR code and watermarked image is displayed on screen.
- Down there it asks permission for uploading generated watermarked image to **IPFS(InterPlanetary File System)** where IPFS stores the image in a folder and gives us a unique  hash address for the uploaded image.
- Now, we can deploy our *watermarked image* to our Blockchain.
- When we click on **Deploy to Blockchain** button, Metamask will ask for the deduction of ethers from our linked account.
- When we are done with the payment, the image will be successfully deployed to the Blockchain.

# Setup
#### 0. Clone this repository using command `git clone https://github.com/Yash2412/copyright-management/` into your system.
### 1. Setting up local Blockchain And Metamask
- Open **Ganache** and create a new *ethereum workspace*
- Ganache will give 10 free accounts, copy the private key of any account.
- Install and login to **Metamask** extension on your browser.
- Click on import account under *my accounts* then paste the copied private key.
- Under *networks* section add a **custom RPC** with url `HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545`.
- Your local Blockchain has started on *http://localhost:7545/* 

### 2. Running Flask Server for Digital Image Watermarking
- Open *terminal window* in the current working directory.
- Change directory to */watermark* by `cd watermark`.
- Create a virtual environment in this directory using *virtualenv* python package.
```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv

$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Running **Flask Server** by
```
python main.py
```
- The Flask server has started and is running on port *http://localhost:5000/*.

### 3. Compiling and Migrating Smart Contract using Truffle
```
$ npm i

$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate
```

### 4. Running Lite Server on *http://localhost:3000/*
```
npm run dev
```
